I am a computer science student with a minor in mathematics at The Pennsylvania State University, graduating in December 2025.

I have solid foundations in **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **full-stack development**. Most recently I've been working on the projects listed:
- [SweetFriend](https://github.com/dmicz/SweetFriend): AI-powered diabetes management.
- [minViT](https://github.com/dmicz/minViT): Minimal Vision Transformer implementation.
- [dmicz.github.io](https://github.com/dmicz/dmicz.github.io): Developer [blog](https://dmicz.github.io) with visualizations and educational content on AI and SWE.
- [devblognotebooks](https://github.com/dmicz/devblognotebooks): Jupyter Notebooks that my exploratory blog posts are based on.
