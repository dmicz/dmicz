## About me

I am a computer science student at The Pennsylvania State University graduating in December 2025.

I previously worked with the SAFARI Research Group at ETH Zurich on implementing experimental tools with Python, Arduino, and Xilinx Vivado.

I'm currently expanding my skills in Python and am learning about machine learning. Most recently I've been working on the projects listed on my [blog](https://dmicz.github.io).
